## InterCos 31

InerCos 31 is an international team of four bachelor students in various fields of study, working toward the development of a single digital solution to design constraints and problems presented by the Munich City Youth District Association. The team was created in a challenge hosted by Hochschule München (HM) in the fall of 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

The Kreisjugendring München-Stadt (KJR) lacks appropriate digital means of communication and engagement with youth in processes within the city of Munich. Youngsters in the KJR's many affiliate youth associations have normally engaged in processes that included discussion, voting, and information exchange in-person at local youth centers under the supervision of group leaders. The onset of COVID-19 limited such activities, and thus stifled youth engagement dramatically. Instagram was used as a temporary solution, but proved inadequate in its privacy policies and data-protection, as well as its lack of basic participatory functions. Shifting activities to a digital platform means that the KJR must be able to cater to young academics and non-academics alike looking to take an active role in their communities. This not only means addressing simple issues such as programming user interface and digital tool implementation, but raises much more complex problems. The customer base may include children and young adults of various racial, ethnic or national backgrounds, and being sensitive to these aspects is important in creating an environment which promotes inclusivity and diversity. In addition, youngsters with disabilities should not be at any sort of disadvantage.

**APPROACH**

The problem was approached systematically through a process beginning with research, followed by rapid brainstorming, ideation, and prototyping.

- Research: This included a study of [precedent projects](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-31/wiki/Research) that have dealt with similar situations in different regions around the world. The issue of youth involvement and the lack thereof was a significant research point, indicating the need for communities to work toward positive relationships between adults and youth, creating a supportive community where youth may find a profound sense of belonging. A wide breadth of [interviews](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-31/wiki/Stakeholder-Interviews) were conducted with youngsters as well as educators to gain a deeper understanding and perspective.

- Brainstorming & Ideation: The next phase involved a synthesis of the research data acquired into a series of imaginary documents, including a [storyboard](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-31/blob/main/Storyboard-7.PNG), a [press release](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-31/wiki/Assignment-Ideation), and [frequently-asked-questions](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-31/wiki/Assignment-Ideation). This helped to make clearer what sort of solution the team wanted to achieve, and the goals to aim for along the way.

- Prototyping: An [initial prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/NT97XEBawDZI0jdY4pDuLH/gxc_prototype_v1.0_31?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down) was produced and shared with the KJR for feedback. The prototype was also tested with other critics including children and web developers. Using feedback from the first prototype, an improved [second prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/2mMAvq56hEX7r5Xwsx5KP8/gxc_prototype_v2.0_31?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down) was produced for final presentation.
